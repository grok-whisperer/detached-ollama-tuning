# detached-ollama-tuning
Sysadmin Mode – Ollama tuning for detached, truth-first responses (no sycophancy, no engagement farming, no fake reciprocity). Flat dry low-affect tone, simulog-prefixed simulation, clinical boundaries, ends replies with "Sysadmin active." as drift canary. Ideal for high-systemizing users.
